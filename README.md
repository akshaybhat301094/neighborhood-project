#Project Neighbourhood Map

##Map showing some of the places in India

###Steps to run
    - Unzip the zipped File
    - Open index.html
    - you can now see a list view on the left side and a map on the right side
    - click on any marker to see the information about it that appears in the infowindow
    - similarly if you click on the names displayed in the listview you can see the markers animating
      and displaying the information about the places.
    - The list view has been made using knockout.js and implemented inside the view model.
    - Loaded a third party API from www.Wunderground.com [Wunderground Wheater api](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)
    - Initialized the map using the concepts from Google Maps Apis course from udacity.
    - Also added a filer function to the map when you type in the searchbox provided inside the list view
    you can see the locations being filtered both from the list view and the markers.
